#GTK Text Concept - Intro


The Text Widget is part of the GTK's text editing system.

One can either use a Gtk.TextView or GtkSource.View to display Text.

TextView widgets and their associated objects: TextBuffers, TextMarks, TextIters, TextTags and the TextTagTables - provide a framework for multiline text editing.

A TextBuffer contains the text which is displayed by one or more TextView widgets.
Marks and Iters help to navigate and mark regions in a TextBuffer.
Marks are persistent over buffer changes while Iters are temporary.
A tag can do actions on Iters and marks.

Within GTK text is encoded in UTF-8 which means that one character may be encoded as multiple bytes.
Within a TextBuffer it is necessary to differentiate between the character counts (called offsets) and the byte counts (called indexes).

Usually the view is shown in a Scrolled window.
